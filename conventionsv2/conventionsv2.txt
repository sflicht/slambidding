In v2 of the convention fileformat, we adopt a different approach, that of
user-specified "sequences". Making the conventionmaker for this version will
be harder, but on the other hand, the XML files are more human-readable.

For now, this is tailored to non-competitive auction sequences, although there
is some flex built into the design for future extension to competitive 
sequences.

as before, the root is the convention element

the name elements give user-specified names for the convention

the actions element contains the possible actions in the convention

action elements must have 
    1) an attribute bid="<some valid call in std format>"
    2) if bid is not "PASS", a list of actions that can be taken response
        to the given action. There must be at least one action, which can
        be a pass element (bid="PASS") if necessary. In the list of actions
        can be put convention elements with name attributes, which are
        stand-ins for other convention files (the entire list of actions
        in those files is substituted).
    3) an element handtypes containing at least one subelement type
        
        each type element may contain elements 
            HCP, spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs, 
                each optionally  with attributes min and max. 
        If no min or max is specified for a given element, the obvious default
        is used. So <handtypes><type /></handtypes> means that the action
        will be taken with ANY hand type, while <handtypes /> means that the
        action is simply NEVER taken. 
        Multiple types allow for bids which show a disjunction of 
        possible hand types, e.g. a 2C response to 1NT.

            POSSIBLE EXTENSION: allow <support> elements with min and max
                attributes, plus a trump attribute ('S','H','D', or 'C')
                specifying the trump suit for computation of support points
            
            POSSIBLE EXTENSION: allow <stopper> element with suit
                and flag attributes (suit is the suit we're asking about
                a stopper for, flag is "0" or "1" depending on whether
                there is a stopper in the hand. ditto for <halfstopper>
            
            POSSIBLE EXTENSION: all <vul> elements with attributes "we"
                and "they" (whose values are 0 for false and 1 for true)
                
            POSSIBLE EXTENSION: allow honorsmin and honorsmax attributes 
                (out of 5 for AKQJT) and also controlsmin and controlsmax 
                attributes (A=2, K=1) for each suit element in a type element.
                So a vulnerable weak 2S suit quality specified as at least 6 cards in length, 
                with 3 of the top 5 and not the QJT would be
                <type>
                    <vul we="1" />
                    <HCP min="5" max="10" />
                    <spades min="6" honorsmin="3" controlsmin="1"/>
                </type>   
                
initially, the supported action elements are
    1) open
        extra attribute: seats, a string e.g. "134" specifying which seats
            the opening is applicable in
    CONSTRUCTIVE AUCTION ELEMENTS
    2) raise
    3) invite
        must have subactions of type accept and decline (at least one of each)
    4) accept
    5) decline
    6) ask
        must have subactions of type tell
    7) tell
    8) pass
    9) signoff
    10) relay
        extra attribute: relayto
    11) relaybid
    COMPETITIVE AUCTION ELEMENTS
    12) overcall
    13) balance
    14) advance
    15) competitiveraise

all except open have an optional attribute "over"
specifying which opponent bids the action remains valid over,
i.e. a list of bids "PASS, X, 2C" etc. Defaults to "PASS". "all"
abbreviates "all legal intermediate bids"


questions:
    how to deal with adding a convention that encroaches upon another?
        e.g. Smolen and Texas on top of Stayman/transfers?
    this is the question of prioritization. the ugly way
        is simply to require the user to revise the definition
        of stayman and transfers to exclude these hand types.
        Whether this could straightforwardly be automated is hard to tell.
        
        ANSWER: put the actions in priority order! XML children are
        ORDERED.

        BUT: Make sure each possible call occurs in AT MOST ONE action element.
        so the Smolen convention cannot contain the action of bidding 2C
        (an ask) but must rather specify the subsequent bids with smolen hand type.
        which means that Stayman (which DOES contain the 2C action) must
        be tailored to include or not include Smolen.
        hmmm


for reference:
remove tabs (those created as multiple " "s)
while preserving all single " "s:
    awk '$1=$1' infile > outfile
    
remove newlines:
    cat auto2new.conv | tr -d '\n' > auto2.conv
